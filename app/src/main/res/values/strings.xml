    <string name="psikoloji">History of psychology</string>
    <string name="psikolojitext">The first steps of psychology were taken with curiosity and interest in understanding human mental processes and behaviors. People have been trying to understand each others behaviors, feelings, and thoughts for thousands of years. However, the establishment of psychology as a modern scientific discipline dates back to the 19th century.

The scientific foundations of psychology were laid when Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental psychology laboratory at Leipzig University in Germany in 1879. Wundt pioneered the study of the human mind using experimental methods, thus establishing psychology as a science.

Psychology then continued to develop under different schools and perspectives. Various theoretical approaches such as structuralism, functionalism, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and cognitive psychology were developed.

The development of psychology has been supported by advancements in research methodologies and technologies. Tools such as computers, neurological imaging techniques, and statistical analysis methods have enabled more in-depth and complex psychological research.

Today, psychology is a discipline that encompasses a wide range of fields and involves various research and application areas aimed at understanding, explaining, and improving human behaviors. The advancement of psychology is the result of a continuous effort and exploration process to understand oneself and the environment.</string>

    <string name="enflasyon">Causes of inflation</string>
    <string name="enflasyontext">Inflation occurs when the general price level of goods and services in an economy rises continuously. This increase in prices reduces the purchasing power of a currency, meaning that the same amount of money can buy fewer goods or services over time. Inflation can be caused by various factors, including excess demand where demand outstrips supply, leading to higher prices. Cost-push inflation happens when production costs increase, prompting businesses to pass these costs onto consumers through higher prices. Monetary factors, such as an increase in the money supply, can also contribute to inflation by increasing the amount of money circulating in the economy. Additionally, imbalances in supply and demand, fluctuations in exchange rates, and international price movements can all influence inflation levels. Government policies, such as taxation and monetary policies, can either mitigate or exacerbate inflationary pressures. Furthermore, expectations of future price increases by consumers and businesses can drive inflation as they adjust their behavior accordingly. Natural disasters or unforeseen events can disrupt supply chains or damage infrastructure, leading to price increases for certain goods or services. Finally, increases in labor costs, such as wages and salaries, can also contribute to inflationary pressures by raising production costs for businesses.</string>

    <string name="spider">Do we really swallow spiders while sleeping?</string>
    <string name="spidertext">People often mistakenly believe the myth that ,humans swallow an average of 7 spiders per year while sleeping,. However, this claim is entirely false and lacks any scientific basis. The idea likely originated as an urban legend or as a way to illustrate how misinformation spreads rapidly. In reality, the likelihood of swallowing spiders while asleep is extremely low. Our bodies have natural reflexes, even during sleep, to prevent foreign objects from entering our mouths. Additionally, spiders are not inclined to crawl into the mouths of humans. This myth serves as an example of how easily misconceptions can become ingrained in popular belief, despite lacking any factual evidence. Therefore, individuals should not be concerned about inadvertently swallowing spiders while sleeping, as it is purely a myth</string>

    <string name="ukrayna">Ukraine needs more soldiers</string>
    <string name="ukraynatext">Ukraine’s parliament has approved a new law that aims to facilitate the recruitment of new soldiers.

Under this law, all men aged between 18 and 60 are required to carry documents confirming their registration with the military. Additionally, the law offers incentives such as cash bonuses and financial assistance for housing or vehicles to soldiers. The government emphasized the urgent need for new troops because there may be a shortage of personnel in certain areas.

However, serving troops received disappointing news. A clause that specifies time limits on their service was removed from the law. This is particularly upsetting for soldiers engaged in combat since the beginning of the conflict.

Scientists study these variations. People in one family can have similar variations. This situation tells us if someone is our relative.

Genetic test companies read the genetic code. They do it for different reasons. For example, an adopted child wants to find his or her parents. Sometimes, parents want to know if their baby will be healthy. Also, a person can learn if they will have a disease. For these reasons, genetic tests change people’s lives.</string>

    <string name="microapartment">Tokyo Micro Apartment</string>
    <string name="microapartmentext">Micro-apartments are places that are very small, have very few amenities, very little space, and not many of the home comforts that you’d associate with living in a bigger apartment and certainly in a house.

However, they’re becoming increasingly popular in the Japanese capital, particularly among younger people who’re just starting in the workplace and can’t afford rents for ordinary places, or they may be moving into Tokyo from out of town and want a cheap place to stay.

Each micro-apartment measures just nine square meters, which is under half the size of a typical studio apartment in Tokyo. The benefit’s that there’s zero deposit and no ‘key money’, a nonrefundable gift to the landlord. Monthly rents range from 380 to 610 dollars, depending on where in Tokyo you are.</string>
